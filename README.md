# FileSharingSocketProgramming
write a server application that provides a file-sharing mechanism. the server will first listen to port 8888 and accept as many requests as possible...

the server will first send the files' names numbered from 1 to n where n is the files count.

The client will peak a number and send it to the server

The server will tell the client the length of the selected file and its name with extension then start sending it.

The client will receive the file and store it on the hard drive to be available anytime!
